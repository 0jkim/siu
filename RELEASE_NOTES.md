# 3GPP NR ns-3 module RELEASE NOTES

This file contains release notes for the NR module (most recent releases first).  

All of the ns-3 documentation is accessible from the ns-3 website:
http://www.nsnam.org including tutorials: http://www.nsnam.org/tutorials.html

Consult the file CHANGES.md for more detailed information about changed
API and behavior across releases.

Release NR-dev
--------------

Availability
------------
This release is not yet available.

Supported platforms
-------------------
This release is intended to work on systems with the following minimal
requirements (Note:  not all features available on all platforms):

- g++-4.9 or later
- Apple LLVM version 7.0.2 or later
- clang-3.3 or later

In addition, Python 2.7 (Python 2 series) or Python 3.4-3.7 (Python 3 series)

This release has been tested on the following platforms:
- ArchLinux 2018.10.08 with g++-8.2.1 and Python 3.7.1
- Ubuntu 16.04 (64 bit) with g++-5.4.0 and Python 2.7.12/3.5.2

New user-visible features (old first)
-------------------------

- (error model) Added the NrEesmErrorModel class. It models the NR PHY
abstraction according to LDPC coding, block segmentation, and including
MCS/CQI table 1 and 2.

- (3gpp channel model) 3gppChannelModel can now be used by any other module,
i.e. it is not any more mmwave specific spectrum propagation model. This means
that any subclass of NetDevice can be attached to a channel using this
SpectrumPropagationModel. An additional requirement is that the technology uses
AntennaModel that is implementing AntennaArrayBasicModel interface. This
feature is a basic prerequisite for simulating co-existence of different
technologies that are using the 3gpp channel model implementation.

Bugs fixed
----------
- (scheduler) Fixed the use of a static MCS value in the schedulers
- (spectrum-phy) While looping the packets in the packet burst,
  to send the feedback, extract the RNTI for each loop. Before, it was
  asserting when the RNTI changed. The code does not depend on the
  RNTI previous values, so it should be safe.

Known issues
------------
In general, known issues are tracked on the project tracker available
at https://gitlab.cttc.es/ns3-new-radio/nr

- (nr) Aligned the BwpManager and the various helper/example to the bearer
  definitions in Rel. 15
- (nr) Removed unsupported MmWaveBeamforming and MmWaveChannelMatrix classes.
- (nr) Added a 3GPP-compliant antenna class.
- (nr) Added a 3GPP-compliant UL scheduling request feature.
