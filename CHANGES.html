<h1>
ns-3: API and model change history</h1>
<!--
This ChangeLog is updated in the reverse order 
with the most recent changes coming first.  Date format:  DD-MM-YYYY
-->
<p>
ns-3 is an evolving system and there will be API or behavioral changes
from time to time.   Users who try to use scripts or models across
versions of ns-3 may encounter problems at compile time, run time, or
may see the simulation output change. </p>
<p>
We have adopted the development policy that we are going to try to ease
the impact of these changes on users by documenting these changes in a
single place (this file), and not by providing a temporary or permanent
backward-compatibility software layer.  </p>
<p>
A related file is the RELEASE_NOTES file in the top level directory.
This file complements RELEASE_NOTES by focusing on API and behavioral
changes that users upgrading from one release to the next may encounter.
RELEASE_NOTES attempts to comprehensively list all of the changes
that were made.  There is generally some overlap in the information 
contained in RELEASE_NOTES and this file.  </p>
<p>
The goal is that users who encounter a problem when trying to use older
code with newer code should be able to consult this file to find
guidance as to how to fix the problem.  For instance, if a method name
or signature has changed, it should be stated what the new replacement
name is. </p>
<p>
Note that users who upgrade the simulator across versions, or who work
directly out of the development tree, may find that simulation output
changes even when the compilation doesn't break, such as when a
simulator default value is changed.  Therefore, it is good practice for
_anyone_ using code across multiple ns-3 releases to consult this file,
as well as the RELEASE_NOTES, to understand what has changed over time.
</p>
<p>
This file is a best-effort approach to solving this issue; we will do
our best but can guarantee that there will be things that fall through
the cracks, unfortunately.  If you, as a user, can suggest improvements
to this file based on your experience, please contribute a patch or drop
us a note on ns-developers mailing list.</p>

<h1>Changes from NR-v0.1 to NR-v0.2</h1>
<h2>New API:</h2>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2>Changes to existing API:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The supported bearers QCI are only the ones defined in Rel. 15.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Ue NoiseFigure is not anymore hard-coded value, instead can be 
    configured through the new MmWaveUePhy attribute called "NoiseFigure".
  </li>
  <li>
    MmWaveEnbDevice and MmWaveUeDevice have new attributes AntennaNumDim1 and 
    AntennaNumDim2 that allow the configuration of a rectangular antenna. 
    Previously only squared antenna was supported.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new AntennaArray3gppModel is introduced that inherits all the features of 
    the AntennaArrayModel, but it considers 3GPP directional antenna elements 
    instead of ISO antenna elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    GnbAntennaArrayModelType and UeAntennaArrayModelType attributes are 
    added to MmWaveHelper that allow the configuration of the antenna type 
    (ISO vs 3gppp) of gNb and UE, respectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    3gppChannelModel has a new attribute "speed" for configuring the speed. 
    Previous and currently the default behaviour is that 3gppChannelModel 
    calculates the relative speed between the transmitter and the receiver 
    based on their positions. However, this parameter can be configured when 
    the static scenario is being used but is desired to imitate small scale 
    fading effects that would exist in a mobile scenario. 
  </li>
  <li>
    AntennaArrayModel has a new attribute AntennaOrientation that can be used 
    to configure the antenna orientation which can be horizontal in XY 
    plane, or vertical in ZY plane.
  </li>
  <li>
    New traces sources are added to the Interference class for collecting 
    the SNR and RSSI values.
  </li>
  <li>
    The attributes <i>MmWaveEnbNetDevice::MmWaveEnbPhy<i> and
    <i>MmWaveEnbNetDevice::MmWaveEnbMac</i> have been removed as they are
    replaced by the component carrier map. GetPhy () and GetMac () for UE
    and gNB NetDevices are now deleted, instead it is necessary to use the
    version with the ccId.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changed behavior:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The SR is now sent only for Component Carrier ID == 0. The Enb Mac
    will receive it and forward to the CC manager; then, the CCM will
    route it to the most appropriate MAC, so the assignation for the SR will be
    done on the appropriate CC.
  </li>
  <li>
    In any given slot, the scheduler will now ignore UEs with new data to 
    transmit if it assigned resources for retransmitting an HARQ process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Default value of the UpdatePeriod parameter of the MmWave3gppChannel is 
    changed to be 1 ms. Note that this dramatically slows down the simulation 
    execution since the channel matrix will be updated every 1 ms. Previously, 
    the default parameter was 0, which means that unless configured differently 
    the channel matrix was not being updated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Previously there was a single propagation loss model, no matter how many 
    BWPs there are in the simulation. Now, there is a propagation loss model 
    instance per BWP. Long story short. MmWaveHelper instantiates a channel 
    instance per BWP. The channel of each BWP is configured by using its own 
    instance of the MmWavePhyMacCommon channel parameters. Since different BWPs 
    are on different frequencies each BWP shall have its own propagation loss 
    model that is configured with the frequency of the corresponding BWP.
  </li>
</ul>
